Hello! I am currently a second year MPhil student in Linguistics at University College London. My research interests center around Semantics, Pragmatics, and Psycholinguistics. I am interested in studying human language production and comprehension through language description and analysis, formal theory construction, psycholinguistic experiments, and computational modelling.
