title: "Plural priming revisited: inverse preference and spillover effects"

abstract: Maldonado et al. \(2017) observe that the distributive interpretation
  of sentences involving multiple plural expressions gives rise to stronger
  priming effects than their cumulative interpretation, and propose to interpret
  this observation in terms of structural priming of the phonologically silent
  distributivity operator. We report on a new experiment that included an
  additional "neutral" baseline condition, whose results reveal that (i) the
  observed priming effects are inverse preference effects in that only the less
  dominant reading in the baseline condition gives rise to sizable priming
  effects, and (ii) both distributive and cumulative interpretations can have
  priming effects, depending on speakers' baseline preferences. We argue that
  these findings undermine Maldonado et al.'s claim that their results evidence
  the existence of the silent distributivity operator in syntax.
